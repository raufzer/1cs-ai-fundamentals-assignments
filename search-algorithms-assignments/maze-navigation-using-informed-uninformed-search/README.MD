# Gopher Escape App

This project implements a maze-solving application using the **Depth-First Search (DFS)** , **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **A star** algorithms. The application visualizes the maze and the solving process, allowing users to generate random mazes and solve them using different algorithms.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Implement the **DFS** and **BFS** algorithms to solve mazes.
- Allow users to generate random mazes and solve them using different algorithms.
- Visualize the solving process and the final path on an interactive grid.

---

## Features

- **Maze Generation:** Users can generate random mazes with specified dimensions.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Solve mazes using DFS or BFS algorithms.
- **Visualization:** Displays the solving process and the final path on an interactive grid.
- **User-Friendly:** Easy-to-use interface for generating and solving mazes.
